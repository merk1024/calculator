Features include all the basic calculator features.
Hint. To input something like 5.0 to the calculator, click the text-field and type 5.0 using the keyboard´s numeric keys and the dot key.

By default, Calculator returns results in the form of x.y(for example, 2.0).

<b>Doing calculations (example)</b>

Press number, like 5 then press +,-,* or / and press another number, like 5. Next press = sign to get the result.
If you want to do a longer calculation do it like this: 5 * 5 = * 10. 
Press 5 and then * and then 5. Now press = to get the result.After the result, continue calculations.
If you do 5 * 5 * 5 the result will be 25 and not 125 like it should be. To overcome the issue, use the steps outlined above and get a result of 5*5 first and then continue multiplying the numbers further.

_______________________________

<b>Still to implement</b> 

Keypress functionality for division, multiply, plus and minus keyboard keys.
You can type the numbers to the text-field and press buttons with the mouse. Numbers are accepted from the keyboard when the text-field is selected(clicked). The keys lacking support, as mentioned above, will be integrated in the future releases.

<b>About project’s structure</b>

dist folder has the .jar file. --> the executable you want to run. 

src folder has project sources. 

nbproject folder has all the Netbeans project files.

______________________________________

<b>Dependencies</b>

The program need Java JRE 1.8 or equivalent to run.

Linux: openjdk-8-jre. Debian/Ubuntu users can install something like: default-jre.

To build the project yourself install Netbeans. Netbeans should be available in most current distributions.

<b>Run program with: java -jar something.jar</b>

You should be able to run the .jar files easily without compiling the project.

Tested with Windows 10 and PostX Gnu/Linux (0.5 Dev build.)
